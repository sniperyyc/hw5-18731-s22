###Welcome to the first homework!!!###

Deadline: Feb 8th @ 12:30pm

My suggestion towards how to start this homework:


* read HW1.pdf and follow instructions;
* copy firewall files;
* get click to run;
* read stateful firewall configuration files;
* read a few samples of policy, pcap, and output files;
* run stateful firewall with one sample input;


Wireshark and tcpdump are your friends in terms of pcap files. :-)

Enjoy!!
