## Welcome to the bonus Firewall homework!!!

Deadline: May 4th, 2022 @ 11:59pm EDT

My suggestion towards how to start this homework:

* read HW5.pdf and follow instructions;
* copy firewall files;
* get click to run;
* read stateful firewall configuration files;
* read a few samples of policy, pcap, and output files;
* run stateful firewall with one sample input;


Wireshark and tcpdump are your friends in terms of pcap files. :-)

Enjoy!!
